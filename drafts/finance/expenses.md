### Expense Reporting

The Carpentries uses Zoho Expense for expense and reimbursement reporting and tracking

#### Creating expenses in Zoho

There are many ways to create expenses, including:

* *Emailing a receipt to Zoho*  If you click on 'Receipt Inbox' in the top right there's an email address. If you email receipts to that email address, it will automatically process them and turn them into an expense. It generally autodetects the amount and vendor.

* *Using the Zoho app to take a picture of a receipt* The Zoho Expense app allows you take a picture of a receipt. Then it asks you if you want to add it automatically. It will take that receipt and get the amount and vendor. 

* *Adding an expense manually* Within Zoho Expense, in 'Expenses' you can click 'New'. Then you can add an expense by writing it in, or by dragging and dropping a receipt. You'll likely need to do this manual add for your Salary expense.

There are categories for each of the expenses. We are tracking expenditures by category, so please add the category to each expense. Pick from whichever is most appropriate in the list.

#### Submitting Expenses

Expenses should be submitted in a report through Zoho once a month, at the end of the month. 

#### Expenses Report

Create expenses individually, including each of the following:
* *Date*
* *Merchant*
* *Category*  We must use CIâ€™s pre-determined categories, which have been entered into Zoho. Please do not create any new categories, but see the list below for explanations of the categories (according to CI) and examples for the Carpentries. Categories that we use often are highlighted for easy identification, since we tend to use the same categories most of the time.
* *Amount*
* *Description of item/Business purpose*
* *Attach receipt or receipt image*

Note: CI needs all of these pieces of information in order to process the reimbursement. 

Create a new report, title it appropriately and add all your expenses for the month to that report (or create the report first and add each expense to it as you create them).

Once your report is together, click 'Submit'. The report will be sent to the Executive Director, who will respond with questions or approve the expense report, passing it on to CI and the Business Manager for reimbursement and recording.
