Hi [name],

I wanted to get in touch with you about an opportunity to get involved with the Software and Data Carpentry community. Software and Data Carpentry are US-based non-profit organizations focused on spreading computational literacy to researchers around the world. We run intensive, hands-on, two-day workshops to help researchers and other professionals develop the fundamental computational skills they need to do their research. Together, we run over 300 workshops a year, and have reached more than 25,000 learners in 30 countries.

Our workshops are taught by volunteers who go through a two-day training program focused on pedagogy and cognitive psychology. These training events are run by our Instructor Trainers who also help to develop and maintain our instructor training curriculum. 

Carpentry Trainers are an eclectic group. Some of us have formal training in pedagogy, some are experienced Carpentry instructors, others run Carpentry-like trainings as part of their jobs. We all share a commitment to helping new instructors become familiar and comfortable with Carpentry teaching practices and principles.

If youâ€™re interested in joining the Trainer community, please apply here! Applications for this round will be open until June 14th. 

If you have any questions about the training process or the expectations for being a Trainer, please get in touch with Erin.

Looking forward to seeing an application from you!

Best,
[name]
