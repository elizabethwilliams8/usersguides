### Release Process and Schedule

Lessons are released on a 6-month release cycle. Lesson releases are
named by the year and month they happen, e.g., `2016.05`.

1.  Each lesson lives in the `gh-pages` branch of its own repository.
2.  When a release is made,
the lesson Maintainer(s) create a branch named after the release,
e.g., `2016.05`.
3.  A Release Maintainer generates HTML pages for that release and adds them to the branch.
4.  If there isn't already a directory for that release in the [`swc-releases` repository][swc-releases],
the Release Maintainer creates one
and adds an `index.html` page to it.
5.  The Release Maintainer adds a submodule to the release directory of [`swc-releases`][swc-releases]
that points to the newly-created release branch of the lesson.
